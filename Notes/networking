NSG is at two level
    - Subnet level
    - Network interface level

* Private IP addresses enable communication within an Azure virtual network and your on-premises network. 
  You create a private IP address for your resource when you use a VPN gateway or Azure ExpressRoute circuit to extend your network to Azure.
* Public IP addresses allow your resource to communicate with the internet. You can create a public IP address to connect with Azure public-facing services.
* Deny rule takes pecedence
* By default, inbound security rules allow traffic from any virtual machine to any other virtual machine within the virtual network.
* Virtual Network is a valid service tag. Service tags represent a group of IP addresses. Other service tags are Internet, SQL, Storage, AzureLoadBalancer, and AzureTrafficManager.
* Network security groups are essential for controlling network traffic in Azure virtual networks.
* NSG rules are evaluated and processed based on priority and can be created for subnets and network interfaces.
* Application security groups provide an application-centric view of infrastructure and simplify rule management.

Virtual Network Peering:-
    - types - Global peering (if we want to connect vnet's of two different regions)
            - Regional Vnet Peering (if want to connect Vnet's in same Region)
    - High data transfer, Easy configuration and great performance
    - uses microsoft backbone network for data transfer, offering privacy and low latency.
    - facilitates connectivity across virtual networks, whether in same region or different region, subscriptions, tenants.

point - to -site- connection: azure users securely can access cloud resources from any location
gateway subnet  + VPN gateway + P2S configuration + download + connect 

site-to-site connection: secure VPN that spans on-premises vpn device and azure VPN gateway which is located with in gateway subject. 
enables your on-premises network to send and recieve data from a virtual network as if they were a part of single large local network.
gateway subnet  + VPN gateway + Local network gateway + On-premises VPN device + siste-to-site 


Vnet peering is cheap compared to Vnet-to-Vnet
CIDR for VNet-a is /30; in Azure, we can only create till /29.
